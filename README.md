# se.alipsa.gi.GuiInteraction
Allows Gade Gui Interactive capabilities from a standalone app

There are three versions of it
1. _gi-fx_ This is the most similar to Gade but requires a JVM with Javafx included (e.g. Bellsoft Full)
2. _gi-swing_ This gives the same functionality as the io in gade but uses swing so works with any JDK but looks slightly different
3. _gi-console_ BEst effort in reproducing gui interaction on the console
